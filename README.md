# CLFields
CLFields is written in Python 3.
Calculation of Stokes parameters and radiation properties from simulated electric field data. This repository contains functions to calculate a mask to simulate a CL mirror, and the Stokes parameters and degree of polarization for simulated 3D electric fields. It also contains functions for plotting fields in Matplotlib in 3D or as an angle-resolved plot, and the necessary coordinate transforms between spherical and Cartesian coordinates.
